# Modal-Workshop
This was a workshop given in class on week two. the object was to make a modal that would appear after 3 seconds on the screen.
The main website has some growing, and positional styling along with a header and background color.
The modal has a different background coloring and spots for a username and an email address, plus a close button and submit button.
The submit button closes the modal only if an @ sign is included in the email slot.
The close button closes the modal without anything needed in any of the slots.
