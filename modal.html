				<h4>Quick Time Info</h4>
				<p class="p">Want more time? Need more time? Well we have the answer for you!  We can't actually create or destroy time, but we can stretch it out.  The price is hight but time is money as they say.  For just $99,999.99 you get a time watch guaranteed to last for 1 year.  1 YEAR?! That is all you'll guarantee?! Yes! That is all we can guaratee.  This is cause 1 year, could last up to 20 years, depending on amount of use. For more information check out the Details and Reasoning sections of this page</p>

				<h4>Reasoning</h4>
				<p class="p">The reason for the high price is simple. If everybody could afford this then everybody would have it. If everybody had it, then everybody would view the stretched time at the same rate. If everybody viewed the stretched time at the same rate, then corporations would expect more done in that time frame.  If corporations want more done in that time frame, then the person using the stretched time has no longer gains the benefit of the stretched time. Thus the price is actually high in order to protect you the client.</p>

				<h4>Details</h4>
				<p class="p">The product is a watch.  We can style it to look like any normal watch that you would like.  There are no identifing marks on the watch to make it stand out in any way.  This is to protect you from thieves targeting you for your watch.  Each watch has a skin sensory scanner that is programed to your personal skin.  This is also a deterant for thieves as the watch will not work for anybody but the client him or her self.  What the watch does is adjusts your brain patterns in a way to recieve data exceptionally fast.  If you must, consider loading a web page on old dial up, then think of loading a web page on a modern wireless system.  The modern is easily 20 times faster.  When activated your mind will recieve data at such a rate the world will go into slow motion. However your body will still respond and move in normal speed.  This is because your mind controls your body and since it is processing data so much faster, your body will do the same.  Don't worry about injury from moving to fast, the reason for injury from these things is mostly in part to the body not being able to respond fast enough or break down fuel fast enough to stop the muscles from straining or pulling.  You can get into all sorts of science about this, but lets get back to the details.  So in reality time hasn't changed just your minds ability to interpret and react has changed, which allows you to move through normal time on average 20 times faster, thus the 1 year can actually feel like up to 20 years.  If you want to know why you would ever turn the watch off, it is simple, only others with the watch turned on would be able to interact with you and thus a good reason to turn the watch off sometimes.  This watch is also banned from being worn in any professional athletic event.</p>
